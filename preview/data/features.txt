Creating tables in LaTeX is a hard task and creating complex tables is an even harder one. This project consists in a free, open source, web-based, WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) table editor for LaTeX. It will aim to support most features used in tables and management of packages (including the possibility to blacklist some of them). A standalone open source JavaScript library will be released in the process to manipulate complex tables.

I'm a well experimented web developper and a proud user of LaTeX. This project is already started, however the support from the community will allow me to work full time on this and release it sooner. The money will be used to pay for icons, for a server, for my rent and for food while development is on the way.
